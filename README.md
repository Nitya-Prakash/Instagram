<p>Basically I have created this for the practice of my javascript concepts.</p>
<p>Here I tried to recreate some of its features like story feature, like feature and follow , unfollow feature.</p>

<p>In story feature, the photo will appear for 3 seconds and then it will disappear automatically.</p>
<p>You can like the post. When you double click, the heart will pop up on the photo.</p>
<p>You can follow , unfollow the ID.</p>

<p>You can try it <a href="https://nitya-prakash.github.io/instagram/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
